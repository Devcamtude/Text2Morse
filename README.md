# Text2Morse
This app   allows users to input text, 
which is then converted into Morse code. The app typically comprises 
a user interface for text input, backend logic for the conversion process, 
and a display to showcase the original text and its corresponding Morse code. 
The app relies on a dictionary to map each character to its Morse code equivalent 
and then generates the Morse code sequence based on the input text. 
Implementation of this app is done with Python and Django -used for the backend, and HTML/CSS/Javascript for the user interface.
